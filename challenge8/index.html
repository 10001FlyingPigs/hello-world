                    Here are four things you must do to get your phone ringing or email box filling up with interview invites. Get started today!
                        
                    Build Your Own Portfolio Site
                    Creating your portfolio is JOB ONE if you want to get a developer job.
                        
                    Do Freelance Projects
                    It’ll give you the chance to build your experience and beef up your bank balance while rounding out your portfolio.
                        
                    Put Your Code on GitHub

                    Github is the industry-standard for version control, so many companies want to know that you already know how to use this tool.
                        
                    Contribute To An Open Source Project
                    You can also increase your teamwork cred by getting involved in an open source project.
                    If you take these four steps, you’ll be accepting your very first junior web developer position in no time at all!
