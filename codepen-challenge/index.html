        Hall began collecting gem sweaters in 2000 and, with the help of her fans, has since amassed over 400 different sweaters.[10] Hall modeled these sweaters on the website gemsweater.com, garnering significant Internet traffic such that she was asked to appear on one of the final episodes of Unscrewed with Martin Sargent. In her 2004 TechTV interview, she stated that "about 65% of the comments" from the gemsweater.com message boards were related to a particular outfit of hers that included gold pants. In the summer of 2005, Hall received a $1,200 grant from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts to turn an RV into a mobile gemsweater museum.[11] She decided to form a band, Leslie and the LY's, with former classmates, capitalizing on the popularity of her gem-laden sweaters and gold pants.
